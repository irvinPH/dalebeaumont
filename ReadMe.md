4. Images: Minifies PNG, JPEG, GIF and SVG images.
5. Watches files for changes in CSS or JS
6. Watches files for changes in PHP.
7. Corrects the line endings.
8. InjectCSS instead of browser page reload.
9. Generates .pot file for i18n and l10n.
 

##Implementations
- Checkout a basic WordPress theme implementation with WPGulp called [WPGulpTheme](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulpTheme).
- More coming soon.

## How?
###METHOD #1
- Clone this repo and build your WordPress project with it
- Configure the project paths in gulpfile.js (Line #23 t0 #38)
- Open the project folder in the terminal and type `sudo npm install`  wait for the files to get downloaded. It will take about 2 minutes to add a node_modules folder inside your project.
- Once the download is complete type `gulp` and boom!

###METHOD #2
- Download `gulpfile.js` and `package.json` files in the root of your WP project
- Configure the project paths in gulpfile.js (Line #23 t0 #38)
- Open the project folder in the terminal and type `sudo npm install`  wait for the files to get downloaded. It will take about 2 minutes to add a node_modules folder inside your project.
- Once the download is complete type `gulp` and boom!

##Prerequisite & Gotchas
- Tested and built on Mac OS Yosemite.
- You must have Git and Node, NPM, Gulp installed globally. 
- You should never commit `node_modules` folder, you should exclude it in `.gitignore` file.

## How to update?
- Delete old ones and download the latest `gulpfile.js` and `package.json` files in the root of your WP project.
- Open the project folder in the terminal and type `sudo npm install`  wait for the files to get downloaded. It will take about 2 minutes to add a node_modules folder inside your project.
- Once the download is complete type `gulp` and boom!
